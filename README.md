These are very handy algorithms to evaluate data through SciLab, specially to be used in complex functions.

I hope you find those useful! Feel free to change or to mail me whenever it is needed.

# Scientific Coding
Here you may find many codes that I worked so far in many different fields and subjects. Basically it is very oriented for science and technology purposes.

# Planning to use any of them? No problem!

Please feel free to use these codes, I really will be happy if it is useful to your project or if it will be embedded into any innovative technology.
